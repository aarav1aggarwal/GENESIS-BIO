Navigation tile 3- SIMULATE MODULE (BioTwin AI)

Purpose: Simulate implanting a printed organ into a virtual human to test outcomes.

🧪 Steps:
	1.	Select Body Model
	•	Age, gender, medical conditions
	2.	Choose Organ to Implant
	•	Liver, Skin Patch, Cornea, Heart Valve, etc.
	3.	Edit Bio-Ink
	•	Adjust materials (e.g., collagen %, scaffold)
	4.	Simulate
	•	AI predicts:
	•	Rejection probability
	•	Healing timeline
	•	Integration success
	•	Risk zones
	5.	Time-Lapse Viewer
	•	See how the implant fuses over time (day 1 → day 90)
